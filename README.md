# 💫 Hi, I'm Vanshika Aggarwal! #


### 📊 Data Science & Machine Learning Enthusiast | Artificial Intellogence | Statistical Modelling ###


I'm **M.sc Data Science** student at the **Chandigarh University**, and hold a **B.Sc. (Hons.) Statistics** from **Delhi University**. My acdemic background has given me a strong foundation in statistical reasoning, data analysis, and computational methods.

I am deeply interested in transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights using **analytics, visualization, and machine learning**. My work focuses on building reliable, interpretable models that support data-driven decision-making across domains such as healthcare, fraud detection, and business analytics.

I approach data science as both analytical and story-telling discipline -  where numbers are translated into insights that matter.


### 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On ###

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Storytelling** :- Conducting in-depth EDA on real-world datasets to identify trends, anomalies, and actionable insights using Python-based visualization techniques.
- **🤖 Machine Learning Models** :- Developing supoervised and unsupervised learning models for classification and regression problems, with emphasis on feature engineering, model evaluation, and interpretability. 
- **📈 Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing** :- Applying probability theory, inferential statistics and regression analysis to validate assumptions and support analytical conclusions.
- **🧠 Foundations of Deep Learning** :- Building conceptual & practical understanding of neural networks and CNNs using TensorFlow/Keras through guided experimentation.
